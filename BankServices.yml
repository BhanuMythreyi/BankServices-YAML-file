    Account holder's transactions were made until 2020, after which not even a single transaction
      --Customer moved to US
    And now requires the money deposited
    Including the fixed deposits made

  query_status: >
    granted
    The customer transactions and the processes made earlier were clear
    hence it would be easy to fulfill the request.
    Also the remarks on the customer should be clean in any case until the process completes smoothly,
    any discrepencies raised further can delay the process.
